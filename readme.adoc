= jQAssistant AsciiDoc Report Plugin

This is the https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc^] report plugin for https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].

After an analysis https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] it renders the input documents that provided rules to HTML documents.

It enriches the output by the status of executed rules as well as their results as tables, embedded diagrams or external links (e.g. CSV).

Furthermore, it provides _++include::[]++_ directives for embedding the results of imported rules and summary tables.

For more information on jQAssistant see https://jqassistant.org[^].

== Using the jqassistant-asciidoc-report-plugin

NOTE:: Starting from jqassistant-rdbms-plugin v2.0.0, the AsciiDoc-Report-Plugin resides under jqassistant-plugin.
Therefore, not only the repository location changed but also group id and artifact id were adapted from `com.buschmais.jqassistant.plugin:asciidoc-report` to `org.jqassistant.plugin:jqassistant-asciidoc-report-plugin`.

NOTE:: From jQAssistant v2.0.0 onwards, it is not part of the core distribution anymore and a manual configuration as shown below is required.
