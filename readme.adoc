NOTE:: With jQAssistant 2.0.0, this plugin has been removed from the core-distribution. It is now available at https://github.com/jqassistant-plugin/jqassistant-asciidoc-report-plugin[jqassistant-asciidoc-report-plugin]

This is the https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc^] report plugin for https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].

After an analysis https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] it renders the input documents that provided rules to HTML documents.

It enriches the output by the status of executed rules as well as their results as tables, embedded diagrams or external links (e.g. CSV).

Furthermore, it provides _++include::[]++_ directives for embedding the results of imported rules and summary tables.
