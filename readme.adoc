This is the http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc^] report plugin for https://www.jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].

After an analysis http://www.asciidoctor[Asciidoctor] it renders the input documents that provided rules to HTML documents.

The output is enriched by the status of executed rules as well as their results as tables, embedded diagrams or external links (e.g. CSV).

Furthermore include directives are provided for embedding the results of imported rules and summary tables.
